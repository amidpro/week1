firstname = "Pri"
lastname = "Adom"

print(firstname, lastname)
# adding a comma to separate variables leaves space between the strings, this is one way to separate strings


print(" ".join([firstname, lastname]))
# this is another way I found out how to space 2 strings together, using .join, will ask what this means

print("Pri Adom")
# also prints the same

# when ran my firstname and lastname should be repeated x 3 "(the number of prints used in this script)
